	-Exercise 3 :
	
		We have an array of bank transactions, which indicates the credit and debit amounts of each person.
		For each person, calculate the real amount of their account and it as a key/value in the array.

		$transactions = array(
		    "Marie" => array(
		        "debit"=>6,
		        "credit"=>9
		    ),
		    "Julien" => array(

	- Final exercise - ONLY FOR THE BEASTS

		We have an array of integers, unsorted, with all numbers from 1 to 50 BUT one element is missing (the array is therefore 49).
		
		The goal is to find the missing item (the missing number).
		However, you have 3 constraints:
		- You have the right to LOOP THROUGH THE ARRAY only once!
		- You have the right to use only one variable (not an array)!
		- You can not use functions (sorting etc ...) You can only count() if needed.

		An example with an array with 9 elements :

			$array = array(5, 1, 3, 2, 9, 6 ,8, 4, 10);
	        // Le nombre manquant est 7

	        $var = ...

	        ...code....

	        echo "Missing number is: " . $var;
